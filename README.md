Fightbox.fr is a E-market website to receive mounthly a secret box which contains products about sport combat.

## History

The project was created by [Sarah Soumahoro](soumahoro@fightbox.fr) who is a practicer of the Jujitsu sport combat. She was alone on the beginning of the project so she started her website by using [Ciklik CMS](https://www.ciklik.co/en/)/. This CMS was in the perfect scope of the requirements of Sarah : A non-developer platform to manage an e-market website which is made to sell products on mounthly subscription payment method.

But customization limitations of the website design told this CMS was not a good long term solution morother Sarah have now a team for the design/UI/UX part.

So the developer has chosen to migrate on other technologies. Firstly for the frontend part of the website application VueJs was chosen cause it's a lightweight frontend framework.

The backend part is not really a final choice yet but it can be the Prestashop CMS which include the possibilty to integrate a VueJs app.
